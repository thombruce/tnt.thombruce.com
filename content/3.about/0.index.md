# About

My name is Thom and this is my Nuxt Template... Thom's Nuxt Template... TNT... Get it? Yeah, the name isn't as cool once you know that.

TNT is my collection of boilerplate code, components and utilities for building any kind of website or application I can imagine.

Check out these testimonials (okay, it is just one from myself testing a feature right now, but give me a shout if you like what I'm doing here):
