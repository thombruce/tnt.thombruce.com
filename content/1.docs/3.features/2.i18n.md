## Site Config

You can internationalize some of the string values that would otherwise be found in your site config in `nuxt.config.ts`. These will take priority over the values found there.

```json [i18n/locales/en.json]
{
  "nuxtSiteConfig": {
    "name": "My Awesome Site",
    "description": "Where I put all my cool stuff!",
    "copyright": "Copyright Â© All rights reserved",
  }
}
```

## Collections

```json [i18n/locales/en.json]
{
  "content": {
    "collections": {
      "pages": "Pages"
    }
  }
}
```
